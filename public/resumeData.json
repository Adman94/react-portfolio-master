Adeeb's inquisitive nature allowed him to quickly grasp new and abstract concepts he needed to excel within the autonomous vehicle industry. Upon finishing his mentorship with me, I went on and observed how he was able to tackle new problems his role entailed and was quickly noticed as a star player in his team. With his proven ability to think critically in a collaborative environment, I'm confident that Adeeb will be an invaluable part of any team that is lucky enough to work alongside Adeeb.",
